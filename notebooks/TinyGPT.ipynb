The heat map tells us a bit more, the MoE heatmap showcases a stronger diagonal, meaning that the model has learned that the most amount of information is closer to the token that it is analysing at the moment, while our first version shows a more distributed, less pronounced heatmap, which suggests a more random behaviour.
